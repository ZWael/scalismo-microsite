# scalismo.github.com 

Code for generating the scalismo website, using the awesome [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).

#### Building the docs

How to build, configure and deploy the site to github pages is explained in detailed in the excellent [Docusaurus Documentation](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/).

Note that the tutorials are generated by [mdoc](https://github.com/scalameta/mdoc). To change the content of the tutorials, 
edit the files in the directory ```docs/mdocs``` and run ```sbt docs/mdoc``` to run and generate the final markdown files.
