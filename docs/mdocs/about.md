## Related Projects
Scalismo is closely related to the 
[statismo](http://www.github.com/statismo/statismo) project, 
and some of the scalismo developers are also actively working on statismo. 
In fact, scalismo had been started as an attempt to provide the core functionality of Statismo and the ITK registration toolkit, but without
the complexity that is induced by these toolkits. 

The design of the registration approach used in scalismo is strongly influenced by [ITK](http://www.itk.org) and [Elastix](http://elastix.isi.uu.nl).
