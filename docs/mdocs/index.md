Scalismo is a library for statistical shape modeling and model-based image analysis in Scala, developed by the
[Graphics and Vision Research Group](http://gravis.cs.unibas.ch) at the [University of Basel](http://www.unibas.ch). It is based on the  the concept of [Probabilistic Morphable Models](https://gravis.dmi.unibas.ch/PMM/). 

The vision of the project is to provide an environment for modelling and image analysis which 

* makes it easy and fun to try out ideas and build research prototypes
* is powerful enough to build full-scale industrial applications
* makes it feasible to deploy it in complex, distributed imaging pipelines. 

We aim to achieve these properties by leveraging two core technologies:

* A simple but versatile [mathematical approach](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8010438/) to shape modeling and registration, based on the theory of Gaussian processes.
* The Scala and Java ecosystem for reducing the software complexity.

## Documentation and getting started

To best way to get started with Scalismo is by checking out the Scalismo tutorials. 

* [Scalismo tutorials](./tutorials.html).

The tutorials are complemented by an introductory lectures on the theoretical concepts, which you can find as part of our online course.

* [Online course on shape modelling (using scalismo)](http://shapemodelling.cs.unibas.ch)

Further resources, including details on the mathematical methods and concepts behind scalismo, as well as tutorials on doing face image analysis using [Scalismo-faces](https://github.com/unibas-gravis/scalismo-faces) are 
collected on the following website:
